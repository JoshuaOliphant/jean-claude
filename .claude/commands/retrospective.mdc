# Retrospective

Conduct a development retrospective to capture learnings and update the jean-claude-dev skill.

## Process

1. **Run retrospective helper script** to analyze recent commits:
   ```bash
   .claude/skills/jean-claude-dev/scripts/retrospective_helper.py
   ```

2. **Review the generated template** in `.claude/skills/jean-claude-dev/references/retrospectives/YYYY-MM-DD-session.md`

3. **Guide reflection** by asking La Boeuf about:
   - What technical insights were discovered?
   - What patterns proved useful?
   - What testing approaches worked well?
   - What pitfalls were encountered?
   - What should be documented in the skill?

4. **Update the retrospective file** with La Boeuf's responses

5. **Suggest skill updates** based on learnings:
   - New sections for SKILL.md
   - Additions to Common Pitfalls
   - Updates to Active Experiments
   - New testing patterns for references/testing_patterns.md

6. **Update skill files** after getting approval

7. **Commit changes** with descriptive message

## Example Interaction

**You:** Let's reflect on the dashboard memory leak work. What did you learn about SSE streaming?

**La Boeuf:** [Provides insights about proper cleanup, background tasks, etc.]

**You:** Great! I'll add that to the retrospective and suggest updating the Common Pitfalls section.

## Output

- Updated retrospective file with learnings
- Proposed updates to SKILL.md (for approval)
- Committed changes to skill repository
