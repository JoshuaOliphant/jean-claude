# Retrospective Sessions

This directory contains retrospective insights from development sessions. Each retrospective captures learnings, patterns discovered, and improvements made.

## Format

Each retrospective should include:
- **Session Date**: When the work was done
- **Work Summary**: What was accomplished
- **Learnings**: Key insights discovered
- **Patterns**: Reusable patterns or approaches
- **Skill Updates**: Changes made to SKILL.md based on learnings
- **Future Considerations**: Items to explore later

## Creating Retrospectives

Use the `/retrospective` command to analyze recent work and create a new retrospective file:

```bash
/retrospective
```

This will:
1. Analyze recent git commits
2. Identify key changes and patterns
3. Prompt for reflection on learnings
4. Create a dated retrospective file
5. Suggest updates to SKILL.md

## Naming Convention

Files are named: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`

Example: `2026-01-04-agent-note-taking-system.md`
